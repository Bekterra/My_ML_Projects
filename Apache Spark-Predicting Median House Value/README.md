# Predicting Median House Value Using Python & Scikit-Learn

**Project Description:**

This project makes use of the California Housing data set. It appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions, written by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry and published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. The researchers built this data set by using the 1990 California census data.

**Data Dictionary:**

These spatial data contain 20,640 observations on housing prices with 9 economic variables:

▪        Longitude refers to the angular distance of a geographic place north or south of the earth’s equator for each block group;

▪        Latitude refers to the angular distance of a geographic place east or west of the earth’s equator for each block group;

▪        Housing median age is the median age of the people that belong to a block group. Note that the median is the value that lies at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values;

▪        Total rooms is the total number of rooms in the houses per block group;

▪        Total bedrooms is the total number of bedrooms in the houses per block group;

▪        Population is the number of inhabitants of a block group;

▪        Households refers to units of houses and their occupants per block group;

▪        Median income is used to register the median income of people that belong to a block group; 

▪        Median house value is the dependent variable and refers to the median house value per block group.
