# Bike Sharing Station Database Analysis

**Project Description:**

Our Analysis


We'll try to answer over the course of this project:

What was the duration of the longest trip?

How many trips were taken by 'registered' users?

What was the average trip duration?

Do registered or casual users take longer trips?

Which bike was used for the most trips?

What is the average duration of trips by users over the age of 30?


**Data Dictionary:**

The database has two tables, trips and stations. To begin with, we'll just look at the trips table, which contains the following columns:

id — A unique integer that serves as a reference for each trip

duration — The duration of the trip, measured in seconds

start_date — The date and time the trip began

start_station — An integer that corresponds to the id column in the stations table for the station the trip started at
end_date — The date and time the trip ended

end_station — The 'id' of the station the trip ended at

bike_number — Hubway's unique identifier for the bike used on the trip

sub_type — The subscription type of the user. "Registered" for users with a membership, "Casual" for users without a membership

zip_code — The zip code of the user (only available for registered members)

birth_date — The birth year of the user (only available for registered members)

gender — The gender of the user (only available for registered members)
