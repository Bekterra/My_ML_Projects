# Data Cleaning With NumPy and Pandas

**Project Description:** :
In this project we will spend a large amount of our time cleaning datasets and getting them down to a form with which they can work. In fact, as we know a lot of data scientists  mention that the initial steps of obtaining and cleaning data constitute 80% of the job.

In this project I'll cover the following processes:

▪ Dropping unnecessary columns in a DataFrame

▪ Changing the index of a DataFrame

▪        Using .str() methods to clean columns

▪        Using the DataFrame.applymap() function to clean the entire dataset, element-wise

▪        Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels

▪        Skipping unnecessary rows in a CSV file


**Datasets :**
Here are the datasets that we will be using:

•    BL-Flickr-Images-Book.csv – A CSV file containing information about books from the British Library

•    university_towns.txt – A text file containing names of college towns in every US state

•    Olympics.csv – A CSV file summarizing the participation of all countries in the Summer and Winter Olympics
