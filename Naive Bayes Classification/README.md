# Naive Bayes Classification Using Python & Scikit-Learn

**Project Description:**
In this project, I will train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. Next, we will test the model on 260 emails. We will ask model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know.

**Data Dictionary:**
All datasets can be dowloaded from repository that I have created on GitHub.
