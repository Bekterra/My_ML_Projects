# Topic Modelling in Python

**Project Description:**

In this project, we will learn how to identify which topic is discussed in a document. We will be using topic modelling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). And we will apply LDA to convert set of research papers to a set of topics. Research paper topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning method that helps us discover hidden semantic structures in a paper, that allows us to learn topic representations of papers in a corpus. The model can be applied to any kinds of labels on documents, such as tags on posts on the website.

**Data Dictionary:**

The research paper text data can be found on my GitHub repo.
