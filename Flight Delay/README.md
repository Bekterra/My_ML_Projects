# Predicting Flight Delay Using Python & R

**Project Description:**
In this project, weâ€™ll use a logistic regression to predict delayed flights. For this project, the best place to get data about airlines is from the US Department of Transportation - https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236 
The data we chose is for a full year extending from November 2013 to October 2014.
